INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (35,'The new light-based quantum computer','Employing a process called boson sampling, Jiuzhang generates a distribution of numbers that is exceedingly difficult for a classical computer to replicate. Here?s how it works: Photons are first sent into a network of channels. There, each photon encounters a series of beam splitters, each of which sends the photon down two paths simultaneously, in what?s called a quantum superposition. Paths also merge together, and the repeated splitting and merging causes the photons to interfere with one another according to quantum rules.\r\n\r\nFinally, the number of photons in each of the network?s output channels is measured at the end. When repeated many times, this process produces a distribution of numbers based on how many photons were found in each output.\r\n\r\nIf operated with large numbers of photons and many channels, the quantum computer will produce a distribution of numbers that is too complex for a classical computer to calculate. In the new experiment, up to 76 photons traversed a network of 100 channels. For one of the world?s most powerful classical computers, the Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight, predicting the results that the quantum computer would get for anything beyond about 40 photons was intractable.\r\n\r\nWhile Google was the first to break the quantum supremacy barrier, the milestone is ?not a single-shot achievement,? says study coauthor and quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. ?It?s a continuous competition between constantly improved quantum hardware and constantly improved classical simulation.? After Google?s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google?s computer completed, at least theoretically.','quantum_computer.jpg','China',11,'2022-06-17 21:12:28','2022-06-17 10:00:45',16),(36,'McIlroy warns LIV jumpers there are some things money can\'t buy','TORONTO: For Rory McIlroy having his name on a trophy is more meaningful than seeing it on a cheque and he offered a warning to golfers chasing a big pay day with the LIV Invitational Golf Series that doing anything purely for money usually does not end well.\r\n\r\nThe Saudi-backed venture which is looking to shake up golf\'s status quo launches this weekend at the Centurion Club just outside London with super-sized purses that dwarf the PGA Tour stop this week, the Canadian Open.\r\n\r\nThe first of eight events that will offer up purses totalling $255 million, the Centurion will pay out $25 million, almost triple the Canadian Open\'s $8.7 million.\r\n\r\nIf those figures aren\'t startling enough then the astronomical sums dangled in front of golf\'s biggest names in effort to lure them away from the PGA Tour are eye-popping.\r\n\r\nLIV Golf CEO Greg Norman told the Washington Post that Tiger Woods turned down an offer that was \"mind-blowingly enormous\" in the high nine figures while other reports had golf great Jack Nicklaus turning down an offer worth more than US$100 million to be the face of the series.\r\n\r\nBut for others the Saudi money was an offer they could not refuse, with six-times major winner Phil Mickelson, according to media reports, getting a US$200 million appearance deal and Dustin Johnson US$125 million.\r\n\r\n\"Any decision that you make in your life that\'s purely for money usually doesn\'t end up going the right way,\" said McIlroy on Wednesday as he prepared to open the defence of his Canadian Open title.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, money is a deciding factor in a lot of things in this world, but if it\'s purely for money it\'s not, it never seems to go the way you want it to.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, with nearly US$63 million in career earnings and millions more in endorsements the Northern Irishman can well afford to not simply do things by the numbers.\r\n\r\nFor McIlroy, who needs a Masters Green Jacket to complete the career Grand Slam of winning all four majors, his decision to remain loyal to the PGA Tour lies with his legacy and quality of life.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the oldest events in our game are National Opens and I\'ve been very fortunate enough to win quite a few, here, Irish Open, US Open, Australian Open,\" McIlroy said.\r\n\r\n\"You\'re putting your name in history by winning these national championships and that\'s something that money can\'t buy.\"','golf.jpg','Canada',14,'2022-06-17 21:17:49','2022-06-17 10:00:45',16),(38,'Teenager\'s Photo In Front Of Bombed School Moves Internet','The post has been shared by a woman Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of the Center for Civil Liberties, Ukraine on Twitter.

The computer, known as Frontier, is the first exascale computer to be included on the biannual list.\r\n\r\nExascale computing is expected to allow for new advances in a variety of scientific fields that depend on vastly complex calculations. The exascale milestone ?represents an unprecedented capability for researchers around the world to use the computer to ask their specific scientific questions,? says Frontier?s project director Justin Whitt of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOak Ridge?s Frontier clocked in at about 1.1 exaflops, or 1.1 quintillion operations per second. Frontier beat out the previous record-holder, a supercomputer called Fugaku at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, which achieved more than 0.4 exaflops.\r\n\r\nWhile tentative reports have suggested that some Chinese supercomputers are already achieving exascale performance, they have not been reported on the TOP500 ranking so far.\r\n\r\nAfter about three years of development, Frontier will be ready for scientists to begin using it at the end of 2022.

It might be the first isolated stellar-mass black hole to be detected in the Milky Way. Or it might be one of the heaviest neutron stars known.\r\n\r\nThe interstellar wanderer first revealed itself in 2011, when its gravity briefly magnified the light from a more distant star. But at the time, its true nature eluded researchers. Now, two teams of astronomers have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images to unmask the traveler�s identity � and have come to somewhat different conclusions.\r\nThe mysterious rogue is a black hole roughly seven times as massive as the sun, one team reports in a study in press in the Astrophysical Journal. Or it�s a bit lighter � a mere two to four times the weight of our nearest star � and therefore either an unusually lightweight black hole or a curiously hefty neutron star, another group reports in a study in press in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.  \r\n\r\nNeutron stars and stellar-mass black holes form when massive stars � at least several times the heft of the sun � collapse under their own gravity at the end of their lives. Astronomers believe that about a billion neutron stars and roughly 100 million stellar-mass black holes lurk in our galaxy (SN: 8/18/17). But these objects aren�t easy to spot. Neutron stars are so tiny � about the size of a city � that they don�t produce much light. And black holes emit no light at all.\r\n\r\nTo detect these kinds of objects, scientists typically observe how they affect their surroundings. �The only way that we can find them is if they influence something else,� says Kailash Sahu, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nTo date, scientists have detected nearly two dozen stellar-mass black holes. (These relatively lightweight black holes are puny compared to the supermassive behemoths that sit at the center of most galaxies, including our own (SN: 1/18/21).) To do so, researchers have watched how these objects interact with their nearby celestial neighbors. When a black hole is locked in a gravitational dance with another star, it rips away matter from its partner. As that material falls onto the black hole, it emits X-rays, which telescopes orbiting the Earth can detect.\r\n\r\nBut finding black holes in binary systems doesn�t paint a whole picture of the black hole kingdom. Because these objects are continually accreting matter, it�s challenging to determine the mass at which they formed. And since birthweight is a key characteristic of a black hole, that�s a significant drawback to looking at binary systems, Sahu says. �If we want to understand the properties of black holes, it�s best to find isolated ones.�','black_hole.jpg','United State',11,'2022-06-15 13:35:23','2022-06-15 13:35:23',4),(57,'New Gaia data paint the most detailed picture yet of the Milky Way','1.6 billion stars. 11.4 million galaxies. 158,000 asteroids.\r\n\r\nOne spacecraft.\r\n\r\nThe European Space Agency�s Gaia space observatory, which launched in 2013, has long surpassed its goal of charting more than a billion stars in the Milky Way (SN: 10/15/16).

The data spanned from January to October 2021.\r\n\r\nAn individual was considered to have a BTI by having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 14 days after having received one dose of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine or two doses of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe team compared this information with that of almost 5 million people from the same healthcare database who did not develop COVID-19 during the same period. Almost 5 million people made up this contemporary control group.\r\nIn an interview with Medical News Today, Dr. Al-Aly explained that studying the control group helped ensure that the long COVID symptoms observed weren�t due to undetected, pre-existing conditions.\r\n\r\nCompared to the control group, people who survived the first 30 days of a breakthrough infection were 1.75 times more likely to die than if they did not develop COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThose in the BTI group also had a greater risk of developing at least one post-acute disorder.\r\n\r\nHowever, results also confirmed that COVID-19 vaccines provide protection. When comparing BTI to unvaccinated individuals who had SARS-CoV-2 infections, the results indicated that COVID-19 vaccines can lower the risk of death by 34% and long COVID by 15%.','covid_at_risk.png','United State',13,'2022-06-12 13:53:47','2022-06-15 14:07:42',4),(59,'Anxiety in men: Fighting stereotypes','Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions worldwide. While they tend to affect women more than men, men are still widely affected. Due to differing social and biological factors, men�s experiences of anxiety, from coping styles to treatment-seeking behaviors, differ from those of women.\r\nIn 2019, 301 million people around the world were living with an anxiety disorder, including 58 million children and adolescents. Estimates suggestTrusted Source that females are more affected than men; 23.4% of females have anxiety in a given year in the United States, and the same is true for 14.3% of males.\r\n\r\nWhile common in men, anxiety disorders have largely been overlooked in men�s mental health literature, meaning there is little high-quality research on the subject.\r\n\r\nMedical News Today spoke with four experts in mental health on topics ranging from how anxiety expresses differently in men and women, to how men seek treatment, and what could improve the way they think about the condition and seek support.','man_anxiety.jpg','United State',13,'2022-06-13 13:55:29','2022-06-15 14:06:07',4),(60,'Alzheimer�s: 6 aspects of the condition that are often misunderstood','The Alzheimer�s Association will be observing Alzheimer�s & Brain Awareness Month this month to increase awareness about Alzheimer�s disease (AD) and other dementias.\r\n\r\nTo mark this event, the Alzheimer�s Association recently published an article describing some of the common misperceptions about the condition as described by individuals with early-stage AD.\r\n\r\nDementiaTrusted Source describes a group of symptoms characterized by memory loss, language problems, changes in mood, and deficits in thinking and reasoning that interfere with daily life activities. AD is the most common form of dementia, affecting over 6 million individuals in the United States.\r\n\r\nAD is a progressive disease involving a steady worsening of dementia symptoms over time. Individuals with AD are often able to function independently in the early stages of the disease but have to increasingly rely on their caregivers for daily activities as the disease progresses.\r\n\r\nIndividuals with a recent diagnosis of Alzheimer�s disease may have a difficult time coping with their diagnosis and need support. Although friends and family members often have the desire to be supportive, they may avoid interacting with the individual with AD due to the fear of negatively impacting their mood.\r\n\r\nAvoiding engagement with individuals with AD promotes a sense of isolation and stigma, and can harm their feeling of self-worth. Below are some of the common misperceptions about AD held by friends and family members according to individuals with early-stage dementia.','alzheimer.jfif','Africa',13,'2022-06-15 13:59:21','2022-06-13 13:59:21',4),(61,'Why Liverpool made Uruguay forward their potential record signing','Darwin Nunez could not have wished for a better audition in front of soon-to-be-boss Jurgen Klopp than scoring twice against Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final.\r\n\r\nThe 22-year-old got a goal in each leg as Benfica slipped to a 6-4 aggregate defeat, taking his tally to six in 10 games in the competition last season and helping convince the Premier League side to agree what could become a club-record �85m deal for the Uruguay international, topping the �75m paid for Virgil van Dijk in 2018.\r\n\r\nWith Sadio Mane looking set to move on, Klopp will continue the evolution of his forward line with a player who was coveted by some of the continent\'s biggest clubs despite having just completed only his second top-flight season in Europe.\r\n\r\nCompatriot Luis Suarez has been banging the drum for the youngster since he first joined Spanish second-tier side Almeria three years ago, but Barcelona\'s financial constraints meant they were unable to capitalise on the veteran striker\'s recommendation.\r\n\r\n\"I have 15 years of international experience, so I know a thing or two about forwards,\" recalled Suarez. \"And I told them, \'pay attention to this one, he\'s very good, he has very interesting things\'.\"\r\n\r\nInstead, it is another of Suarez\'s former clubs that look set to benefit from another emerging South American talent who honed his craft in Portugal, with the Reds having also signed Luis Diaz from Porto in January.','darwin.jpg','Uruguay',14,'2022-06-13 14:01:50','2022-06-15 14:06:07',4);
